# Won first place BC HACK Hackathon
An application that keeps track of amount of calories a student need per day.

Inspiration
Only few students write down the calories intake per food. So we wanted to help every students by making it easy to keep track of how much calories they are consuming. Therefore, we created an application for it.

What it does
Our application keeps track of person's calories intake by asking the name of food that a person is eating. Application will stop running after they have reached their daily calories limit.


Using EDAMAM's API, we were able to get the calories of every single recipes.

Challenges we ran into
Since no member in our group had much experience using Flask, we had to learn and apply the knowledge of Flask at the same time.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our application is successfully keeping track of person's daily calories intake and letting them know when they have reached their goal for the day. This will help students to consume the correct amount of calories needed for their body to stay healthy.

What we learned
We learned to use Flask and combining HTML with multiple python files.

What's next for Food Service
We will eventually publish our application on Playstore and IOS app store.
